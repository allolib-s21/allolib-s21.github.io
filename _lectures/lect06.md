Today I demonstrated some code that demonstrates a few things:

* How to play notes in code directly rather than from a sequence file
* How to use the keyboard to trigger other kinds of events (e.g. an entire sequence of notes) rather than
  just a single note
* The musical idea of a Canon, i.e. a piece where melodies are repeated at various intervals, sometimes 
  unchanged, and sometimes modified: [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(music))
  - faster or slower
  - higher or lower in pitch
  - by inversion (a mirror image of the pitches rising vs. falling) 
  - or retrograde (i.e. playing the melody backwards) 
  
A "round" is a kind of canon&mdash;all rounds are canons, though not all canons are rounds.

A famous round is "Row, Row, Row Your Boat", which is the melodic material in this piece:

We also heard several other demos by students.
